The flipTheCoin is a simple web interface created using React Basics to clear use and purpose of "useState()" and "setstate()".

The web page allows you to select number of coins and also lets you choose the play mode i.e. either fair or biased.
If the play mode is biased, it will reduce the possibility of heads by 70% compared to that of tails. 
While in fair mode, the possibilty of showing up heads and tails are 50-50.
